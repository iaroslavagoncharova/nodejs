## Express MVC and database
The Express app includes functionality for:
- Reading data from the database (using the GET method)
- Sending data to the database (using the POST method)
- Updating existing data in the database (using the PUT method)
- Deleting existing data from the database (using the DELETE method)
- It uses Express framework for implementing API functionality, MVC type-based structure, and a Media Sharing App - database

### Data Retrieval
The application provides access to data fetched from the database, including media items, users, and comments:
- Fetch all media items: `GET /api/media`
- Fetch all users: `GET /api/users`
- Retrieve a specific media item by ID: `GET /api/media/:id`
- Retrieve a specific user by ID: `GET /api/users/:id`
- Retrieve a specific comment by its media ID: `GET /api/comments/media/:id`
- Retrieve a specific comment by its user ID: `GET /api/comments/user/:id`

### Adding New Data
- Add a new media item: `POST /api/media`
- Add a new user: `POST /api/users`
- Add a new comment: `POST /api/comments`
- The POST request should include all necessary information about the user (username, password, email, user_level_id)/media item (form-data: title, user_id, file, filename)/comment (media_id, user_id, comment_text), except for an ID, which is automatically generated by adding 1 to the previous ID in the database

### Modifying Data
- Modify a media item's filename, title, and description based on its ID: `PUT /api/media/:id`
- Modify a user's username, password, and email based on their ID: `PUT /api/users/:id`
- Modify a comment's text based on its ID: `PUT /api/comments/:id`

### Deleting Data
- Delete an item/user based on ID using the DELETE method:
  - Delete a media item: `DELETE /api/media/:id`
  - Delete a user: `DELETE /api/users/:id`
  - Delete a comment: `DELETE /api/comments/:id`

### Response Status Codes
Every response status code is appropriately handled and displayed

### Media Files
The example database is used for fetching media files
